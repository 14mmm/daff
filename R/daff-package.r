#' Data diff, patch and merge for R
#'
#' Daff calculates differences between two \code{data.frame}s. This difference can be stored and later used to
#' patch the original data. Differences can also be made visual by using \code{render_diff} showing what changed.
#'
#' Storing the difference between data sets allows for tracking or incorporating manual changes to data sets.
#' Ideally changes to data should be scripted to be reproducable, but there are situations or scenario's where
#' this is not possible or happens out of your control. \code{daff} can help track these changes.
